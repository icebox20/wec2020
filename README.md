## About

TASP takes the user availability schedule and creates a study plan that helps them prepare for Assignments, Projects, or Exams.
The program prioritizes certain tasks depending on their Due Date & Due Time.
The calculated schedule is then imported to Google Calendars automatically upon task input/submission. 
The user may then refer to the Google calender at any given time.

## Usage

1. Using a python IDE, Run `pip install pygame` to install pygame module

2. Download all files present within the game file on github

3. Load the python code within your IDE and run program

4. Once User interface is shown, select size of your desired chess board and begin playing!

## Directions for using Program
	
1. Rules put in place for each piece:
    * Pawns 
        * Fill the front row of players sides of the board. 
        * Pawns may move in distances of 1-3 squares, and may only take opposing pieces in a diagonal manner
     when they are blocked by opposite team.
    * Bishops 
        *  Move and are placed as normal.
    * Rooks 
        * Move and are placed as normal.
    * Knights
        * Move like a queen, except they can only reach between 2 and 4 (inclusive) squares away
    * Queen
        * They may move in straight and diagonal lines
    * King
        * Moves and should be protected as normal
    * Vanguards
        * May move in an L of any size
       
2. Select any size of chess board you would like to play on

3. Play with your friends using applications such as teamviewer or play over a video call and use the given letters and numbers to say your moves.

## Bugs

## Work Flow

	- Project rolled out using agile methodology with 2 sprints
	- 1st sprint was focused on creating the task class and ui and then understanding how to work with the Google API 
	- 2nd sprint was focused on integrating all parts and creating a task allocation algorithm 

## Future Improvements

	1. Add some sort of CPU that a player can play against if alone.
	2. Improved UI design.
	3. Queen move timer to make the queen not as overpowered in skillset.
	4. Deploying the program online so that it can be played online without any excess factors.
	5. Adding different chess plays such as Castling.
